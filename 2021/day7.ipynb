Now, we need to take into account how many steps it will take to move into a new position. **At each step, the fuel cost increases by one**. Therefore, we can calculate the difference between two points, let's say 3 and 1, which would take 2 steps. Step 1 would cost 1 and step 2 would cost 2. We can use a `range` function to **create a list with as many members as the number of steps it would take**. In this case, this list would be [1, 2]. We can get our result by **adding the values of this list.**"
